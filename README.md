#Dynamic Landing Page Project

In this project, I have used some JavaScript to make the landing page dynamic by creating a tap of every section in the
navigation bar automatically once a new section is added.

I have used ().scrollIntoView) event listener to jump to the wanted section and both (.mouseover) and (.mouseout) events
to highlight the active section in the navigation bar.

I also have modified both the html and css file a little to work with my approack
